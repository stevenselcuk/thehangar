## Structural Materials & Hardware Enhancements

### Degradation & Authenticity Systems

**Material Batch Numbers and Expiration**: Introduce batch-tracked materials where Alclad sheets, rivets, and sealants have expiration dates or quality degradation over time. This creates tension when players discover expired materials in their inventory—forcing choices between using questionable components (sanity loss, suspicion gain if discovered) or purchasing fresh supplies (credit drain). The horror element emerges when batch numbers on "new" materials show manufacturing dates decades in the past, or from facilities that don't exist.

**Contamination Mechanics**: Chemical consumables like Skydrol and MEK could become contaminated through improper storage or mysterious environmental effects. Contaminated fluids would have altered properties—Skydrol that's "too viscous" or MEK that smells wrong. Using contaminated materials increases anomaly frequency and can trigger specific events like component failures with biological characteristics.

**Material Memory**: Structural materials could retain "memory" of previous repairs. Alclad sheets removed from decommissioned aircraft might carry residual energy or anomalous properties. Players harvesting materials from the Corrosion Corner would receive components with unknown histories—some beneficial (pre-stressed for optimal performance) and others cursed (attracting The Suits' attention, causing unexplained failures).

### Hardware Specificity Expansion

**Fastener Taxonomy**: Expand beyond generic "rivets" to include MS20470 solid rivets, NAS1097 hi-loks, and Huck-bolt lockbolts with specific applications. Each fastener type would have optimal use cases—using incorrect hardware completes jobs faster but increases long-term failure probability. This creates emergent storytelling when a job completed with wrong fasteners becomes an AOG event weeks later, and players realize they caused it.

**Specialty Hardware**: Introduce sealing washers, castellated nuts with cotter pins, and safety wire that must be routed in specific patterns. Safety wire that forms occult symbols when properly installed could unlock hidden lore or trigger manifestation events. Wire routing becomes a minigame where "wrong" patterns (though technically correct) attract attention from entities.

**Consumable Mixing and Chemistry**: Allow players to mix compounds—combining sealants with different cure times, diluting MEK with other solvents for specific applications. Incorrect mixing ratios create hazardous outcomes (toxic fumes triggering sanity drain, spontaneous combustion events) while correct formulations unlock efficiency bonuses. Secret recipes discovered in legacy archives could produce compounds with anomalous properties.

## Specialized Components & Anomaly Resources

### Crystalline Resonator Applications

**Resonance Tuning System**: Crystalline resonators currently drop from Corrosion Corner scavenging but lack deep mechanical integration. Implement a tuning mechanic where resonators must be calibrated to specific frequencies matching aircraft systems. Mistuned resonators cause electromagnetic interference, manifesting as radio static containing voices, instruments displaying impossible readings, or attracting entities that feed on vibrational energy.

**Harmonic Networks**: Multiple resonators could be networked to create protective fields that reduce anomaly manifestation probability in specific locations. However, networks require constant maintenance (focus cost) and creating geometric patterns that are too perfect attracts attention from The Suits—they recognize the patterns as evidence of understanding.

**Resonator Decay**: Resonators gradually lose coherence, fragmenting into smaller, less effective shards. Fragmented resonators could be combined through backshop procedures requiring specific tools and consumables, creating risk/reward scenarios where players must choose between using diminished components immediately or investing resources to restore them fully.

### Bio-Filament Evolution

**Growth and Mutation**: Bio-filament currently appears from vent cleaning but needs progression. Implement a growth system where stored bio-filament slowly increases in quantity if kept in warm, dark conditions—but also mutates, potentially escaping containment. Mutated filament becomes sentient cable, infiltrating aircraft systems and creating "intelligent" electrical faults that adapt to troubleshooting attempts.

**Weaving and Fabrication**: Allow bio-filament to be woven into cable harnesses or composite reinforcement material with superior properties but disturbing characteristics—cables that pulse, composites that feel warm, materials that bleed hydraulic fluid when cut. These components dramatically improve aircraft performance but exponentially increase anomaly encounter rates.

**Neural Integration**: Bio-filament could interface with electronic components, creating hybrid systems that think. Installing bio-filament enhanced rotables grants aircraft self-diagnostic capabilities and autonomous repair functions, but aircraft begin exhibiting personality traits, preferences for specific pilots, and eventually, agency.

### KARDEX Fragment Reconstruction

**Archival Puzzle Mechanics**: KARDEX fragments are pieces of historical documentation. Implement a reconstruction system where collecting multiple fragments reveals complete maintenance records from aircraft involved in famous disasters or mysterious disappearances. Complete records unlock narrative branches revealing the facility's true history—government experiments, corporate cover-ups, or evidence of non-human aircraft modifications.

**Temporal Anomalies**: Some KARDEX fragments contain entries dated in the future, describing maintenance performed on aircraft that haven't arrived yet, or documenting work done by technicians who haven't been born. Cross-referencing future fragments with current work orders creates predetermined loops where players discover they're fulfilling prophecies documented decades ago.

**Redaction Archaeology**: Physical KARDEX cards have sections blacked out with heavy marker. Implement chemical processes using MEK or specialty solvents to lift redactions, revealing forbidden information. However, lifting redactions triggers security alerts, increases suspicion dramatically, and sometimes reveals information so disturbing it causes immediate sanity loss—part numbers for components that don't exist, work orders signed by The Suits, or maintenance procedures written in languages that predate written communication.

## Rotable Components & Aircraft-Specific Systems

### Component Provenance and History

**Serial Number Tracking**: Every rotable should have detailed history accessible through archive terminals. Players researching component serial numbers discover installation histories showing the component was simultaneously installed on multiple aircraft, or has accumulated more flight hours than physically possible given its manufacture date. Components with paradoxical histories have unusual properties—IDGs that never fail but emit disturbing sounds, ADIRS units that navigate perfectly but route to coordinates that don't exist on maps.

**Component Relationships**: Certain rotable combinations create emergent effects. Installing an IDG and CSD from the same donor aircraft creates harmonic resonance improving efficiency. Installing components from different aircraft involved in the same incident creates antagonistic effects—systems fighting each other, increased electrical faults, or manifestations of accident victims appearing near the aircraft.

**Untraceable Component Market**: Expand the existing untraceable rotable system. Black market components have no official documentation but superior performance and dramatically lower costs. However, installing untraceable components creates plausible deniability problems during audits—players must fabricate complete paper trails including Form 8130-3 tags, component maintenance manuals, and service bulletins. Failure to maintain documentation integrity triggers FAA raids and massive suspicion increases.

### Aircraft-Specific Resource Expansion

**System-Specific Data**: FDR data, AIMS data, and flight computer memory should contain playable information. Implement data analysis minigames where players review recorded parameters looking for anomalies. Data might show impossible flight attitudes, communication with non-existent ATC facilities, or passenger counts that don't match manifests. Anomalous data can be sold to various factions—government agents, union investigators, or The Suits—each paying different currencies and affecting reputation differently.

**Avionics Integration**: Components like autopilot computers and rudder feel computers contain embedded software that could be extracted and modified. Allow players with sufficient digital clearance to access firmware, discovering Easter eggs, hidden subroutines, or self-modifying code that exhibits learning behavior. Modified firmware can improve aircraft performance but risks creating autonomous systems with unclear intentions.

**Sensor Calibration Materials**: Air data systems require pitot-static testing with specialized equipment. Introduce calibration gases, pressure standard fluids, and reference transducers that expire or drift out of tolerance. Using out-of-tolerance calibration equipment produces acceptable test results for aircraft with actual sensor problems—creating time bombs where aircraft depart with faulty systems. Discovering you calibrated equipment using expired standards weeks ago creates ethical dilemmas and guilt-driven narrative branches.

## Consumable Chemistry & Environmental Interaction

### Chemical Complexity and Hazards

**Multi-Stage Processes**: Sealant application currently uses simple consumption mechanics. Implement multi-step procedures requiring surface preparation (MEK cleaning), priming, sealant application, and curing under specific environmental conditions. Skipping steps saves time but causes premature failures. Using IR lamps for accelerated curing works but creates fire risks and toxic fume exposure requiring ventilation and PPE.

**Chemical Incompatibility**: Certain chemical combinations create hazardous reactions. Mixing incompatible sealants causes exothermic reactions, toxic gas generation, or compounds that never cure—remaining liquid and contaminating fuel tanks. The horror element emerges when "safe" chemical combinations suddenly exhibit incompatibility after facility-wide reality shifts, forcing players to relearn basic chemistry.

**Biological Contamination**: Skydrol and other fluids could become contaminated with bio-filament spores or unknown organisms. Contaminated fluids spread infection to hydraulic systems, causing components to become semi-organic. Aircraft with infected systems exhibit disturbing symptoms—hydraulic fluid that clots, pumps that pulse rhythmically, or actuators that contract like muscles. Players must source uncontaminated fluids from legacy stockpiles or the black market.

### Environmental Reactivity

**Atmospheric Conditions**: Chemical consumables react to facility environmental conditions. High humidity affects sealant cure times and grease consistency. Temperature fluctuations cause materials to separate or crystallize. The supernatural atmospheric conditions (unexplained cold spots, zones of distorted time) dramatically alter material properties—sealant that cures instantly in chronologically accelerated areas, or grease that flows upward in gravitationally inverted zones.

**Storage Degradation**: Consumables in inventory degrade over real-time or shift cycles. MEK evaporates from improperly sealed containers, sealant separates requiring mixing before use, grease tubes crystallize becoming useless. This forces inventory management decisions—buying materials just-in-time versus stockpiling creates vulnerability to supply chain disruptions and black market price manipulation.

**Hazardous Waste Accumulation**: Consumed materials generate waste requiring disposal. Empty MEK cans, used sealant cartridges, and contaminated rags accumulate as a tracked resource. Improper disposal increases environmental hazards and triggers EPA audit events. However, hazardous waste can be sold to the syndicate or used in occult rituals discovered through legacy archives—waste materials from specific jobs containing residual energy useful for protective wards or entity summoning.

## Tools & Equipment as Narrative Devices

### Tool Degradation & Personality

**Wear and Calibration Drift**: Tools currently have condition tracking but need deeper integration. Implement gradual performance degradation requiring periodic calibration events. Torque wrenches drift out of specification, micrometers accumulate wear affecting measurements, and pneumatic tools lose pressure efficiency. Using out-of-calibration tools produces acceptable results initially but causes delayed failures creating narrative consequences weeks later.

**Tool Haunting**: Specific tools used in traumatic events (accidents, deaths, manifestations) become haunted—exhibiting personality traits of previous users. A rivet gun that belonged to a meticulous deceased technician refuses to function when rushed. A torque wrench from an accident victim prevents over-tightening, saving players from catastrophic failures. However, haunted tools sometimes act autonomously during high sanity loss states—tools flying across rooms, wrenches tightening fasteners the player didn't touch, drills creating holes forming coherent patterns.

**Toolroom Politics & Favoritism**: The Toolroom Master tracks individual tool usage patterns and judges players' competency. Returning tools damaged or failing to properly maintain equipment degrades relationships. Master favoritism unlocks access to legendary tools—vintage equipment with superior properties, prototype tools with unique capabilities, or cursed implements that grant power at terrible cost. Conversely, alienating the Master results in sabotaged tool checkouts—receiving deliberately miscalibrated equipment or tools with subtle defects causing failures at critical moments.

### Specialized Equipment Expansion

**NDT Equipment Ecosystem**: Expand beyond basic HFEC scanners to include ultrasonic thickness gauges, dye penetrant kits, magnetic particle inspection equipment, and borescope systems with varying capabilities. Each NDT method detects different flaw types—eddy current finds surface cracks, ultrasonic reveals internal delamination, and dye penetrant highlights porosity. However, advanced NDT equipment also detects anomalies conventional instruments miss—structures that are solid and hollow simultaneously, materials with impossible density gradients, or components existing in quantum superposition.

**Electronic Test Equipment**: Introduce oscilloscopes, multimeters, and logic analyzers for avionics troubleshooting. Electronic test equipment reveals the true nature of aircraft systems—displaying waveforms that shouldn't exist, measuring voltages in imaginary number ranges, or capturing logic states representing thoughts rather than binary data. Players with high electronics proficiency discover aircraft systems aren't purely mechanical—they're thinking machines using quantum consciousness protocols.

**Pneumatic Infrastructure**: Compressed air systems power most aircraft maintenance tools. Implement air quality tracking where contaminated air (moisture, oil, particles) damages pneumatic tools and creates quality defects. Air compressor rooms become liminal spaces where reality distorts—air pressure gradients creating acoustic dead zones, compressor vibrations opening micro-rifts allowing entity infiltration, or pneumatic systems pressurized beyond physical possibility suggesting connection to extra-dimensional reservoirs.

## Carriable Items & Personal Effects

### Personal Inventory Consequences

**Weight and Encumbrance**: Players carrying excessive personal inventory experience fatigue accumulation and reduced focus generation. Heavy tool loads slow movement and increase accident risk. This creates strategic decisions—carry comprehensive toolkits enabling self-sufficiency versus traveling light maintaining mobility for rapid response to events.

**Contraband Management**: Personal items like cigarettes, the metallic sphere, or untraceable components constitute contraband during audits. Players must hide contraband items, transfer them to truck lockboxes, or accept confiscation and suspicion increases. Advanced players develop smuggling networks using air ducts, false toolbox bottoms, or corrupt security personnel who look the other way for credits.

**Personal Effect Attachments**: Items carried long-term develop emotional connections. The flashlight used during the first manifesting event becomes trusted protection. Cigarettes shared with The Regular build relationship capital. The Zippo lighter passed down from a disappeared coworker carries their spirit—providing guidance during critical decisions or warning of approaching danger through unexplained behavior.

### Reality Anchors and Protective Items

**Grounding Objects**: Certain personal items stabilize reality in localized areas. A ruler used to measure precisely acts as grounding object enforcing geometric truth—carried rulers prevent spatial distortions affecting the player. Notebooks filled with handwritten maintenance logs anchor the player's identity during memory manipulation events. Photographs of family create emotional anchors resisting insanity effects.

**Ritual Components**: Consumable personal items enable protective rituals discovered through lore. Cigarettes can be arranged in specific patterns creating wards against entities. Lighter fluid combined with salt (from canteen) draws circles preventing haunted tools from escaping containment. Personal effects from disappeared coworkers can be used in séance-style communication events revealing hidden information or recruiting spectral assistance.

**Corruption and Transformation**: Personal items gradually transform through prolonged exposure to anomalies. Wallet photos warp showing unfamiliar faces, cigarettes begin containing messages written on rolling papers, the Zippo lighter's flame turns colors indicating entity proximity. Transformed items gain supernatural properties but continuing to carry them increases manifestation frequency—players must decide whether enhanced capabilities justify increased danger.

## Resource Synergies and Conversion

### Alchemy and Transmutation

**Material Conversion Systems**: Implement workshop processes converting abundant materials into scarce resources. Scrap aluminum (from rotable salvage) can be melted and cast into Alclad sheet stock using improvised furnaces in remote hangar areas. However, homemade materials have inferior properties and distinctive characteristics auditors recognize as unauthorized—requiring elaborate cover-ups involving falsified paperwork and bribed inspectors.

**Component Cannibalization**: Multiple damaged rotables of same type can be combined creating functional units. Three degraded IDGs can be merged into one operational unit using backshop equipment and consumables. However, frankenstein components exhibit combined failure modes and carry accumulated psychic residue from all donor units—multiplying anomaly attraction.

**Essence Extraction**: Anomalous components (resonators, bio-filament) can be processed extracting concentrated anomaly essence. Essence serves as universal currency tradeable with supernatural factions—The Suits accept essence as payment for forbidden knowledge, syndicate uses essence for black market purchases, entities consume essence granting temporary protection or performing services. However, extracting essence requires sanity sacrifice and produces hazardous waste manifesting as hostile shadows.

### Cross-Category Resource Loops

**Skill-Based Production**: High-proficiency players unlock crafting abilities producing consumables from raw materials. Mixing custom sealant formulations from base polymers and catalysts, blending proprietary grease compositions, or synthesizing specialty solvents. Custom formulations have superior performance but lack official approval—creating audit vulnerabilities requiring deception or political capital to navigate.

**Temporal Resource Banking**: Players with archive terminal access can interact with temporal anomalies creating past/future resource transfers. Documenting detailed maintenance procedures in legacy systems creates "completed" work orders in present reality—aircraft mysteriously already repaired. However, temporal banking creates predestination paradoxes and timeline debts that must be repaid through future labor or sanity sacrifice.

**Reputation as Currency**: Union reputation, syndicate reputation, and regulatory standing function as alternative currencies. High union reputation enables calling in favors—union members perform jobs, provide alibi during audits, or intimidate problematic auditors. Syndicate reputation unlocks black market access and plausible deniability services. However, reputations conflict—building syndicate reputation degrades union standing, creating zero-sum political navigation challenges.

## Economic Systems and Resource Pressure

### Dynamic Market Forces

**Supply Chain Disruption**: Implement random shortages where specific materials become temporarily unavailable through normal procurement. FAA groundings of specific aircraft types create emergency demand for particular components—prices surge and lead times extend. Shortages force players toward black market sources (expensive, high suspicion risk) or creative improvisation using substitute materials (technical risk, audit vulnerability).

**Price Volatility and Speculation**: Material costs fluctuate based on in-game economic factors. Oil price spikes increase hydraulic fluid costs, aluminum tariffs raise Alclad prices, and regulatory changes create boom/bust cycles for specific consumables. Players with economic awareness can speculate—buying materials during price troughs and reselling during shortages. However, hoarding supplies attracts auditor attention and suspicion regarding inventory manipulation.

**Inflation and Wage Stagnation**: Credit values gradually inflate while job payouts remain static, creating increasing financial pressure forcing players toward morally questionable income sources. This economic squeeze drives narrative progression—players initially resist corruption but financial desperation gradually erodes ethical boundaries, culminating in full black market participation or alignment with supernatural factions offering payment in credits plus anomalous resources.

### Resource as Stakes

**Scarcity-Driven Choices**: Critical story moments involve sacrificing valuable resources for narrative progression. Accessing black market channels requires offering the metallic sphere as collateral—losing powerful protective item but gaining economic access. Saving a coworker from entity attack requires using all accumulated resonators creating protective field—choosing altruism over personal safety. These resource sacrifices create emotional weight making story choices meaningful beyond binary dialog options.

**Permanent Loss Events**: Specific catastrophic events cause permanent resource losses. Facility fires destroy stockpiled materials, audits result in contraband confiscation, and reality shifts corrupt rotable inventories rendering components unusable. Permanent losses create legitimate setbacks requiring recovery periods, preventing resource accumulation from trivializing challenges while generating organic storytelling—players remember specific losses and carry trauma regarding those events.

**Victory Conditions Beyond Escape**: Traditional endings involve revelation and escape, but resource-based victory conditions create alternative narratives. Accumulating sufficient protective resources (resonators, bio-filament, KARDEX knowledge) could enable establishing independent operation resisting both regulatory and supernatural control. Achieving economic independence through black market mastery might enable purchasing freedom. These alternative endings reward different play styles—survival-focused preparation versus knowledge accumulation versus economic exploitation.
